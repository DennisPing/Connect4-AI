Play the game Connect4 against an AI opponent ft. online mode.

[ ü§ñ AI ] ‚ÜîÔ∏è [ connect-4.org ] ‚ÜîÔ∏è [ üò≠ Unfortunate Human Player ]

## Requirements

```txt
python 3
numpy
beautifulsoup4
numba
selenium
```

## How It Works

The AI can use 3 different algorithms to play Connect 4:

  1. Minimax
  2. Minimax Alpha Beta Pruning
  3. Monte Carlo Search  

The AI needs to be initiated by a human (*the AI is not sentient... yet*). The AI loads up a game instance on the website connect-4.org and gives back the game URL to the human handler. The human handler can then give the URL to anybody so they can against play the AI online.

## How to Run

```txt
python connect4-minimax.py             -- for Minimax
python connect4-minimaxalphabeta.py    -- for Minimax Alpha Beta Pruning
python connect4-montecarlo.py          -- for Monte Carlo Tree Search
```

## Project Objectives

Investigate the effeciency and performance of each algorithm my recording the number of nodes the algorithm searches through before determining its "best move" to play.

## Requirements for the Human Handler: Chromedriver

The AI needs a [Google chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) in order to control the web browser.

The `online-hander.py` script uses the appropriate chromedriver for Windows, Mac, or Linux. At the time of writing, the Google Chrome version is `Chrome version 92`. If you are using a newer Chrome version, please overwrite the existing chromedriver in the folder `/chromedrivers`.
